                  Welcome! My name is <strong>Meenu Sundararaju </strong>and
                  I'm a highly motivated Junior at Michigan State
                  University majoring in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and minoring
                  in <strong>Mathematics</strong>.
                  I have a strong passion for <strong>numbers</strong>--specifically
                  in finding patterns within <strong>unstructured data</strong> and allowing the numbers
                  to tell a story. Upon graduation, my goal is to <strong>write code</strong>
                  that makes
                  a <strong>positive impact</strong> on our society. In my free
                  time I can usually be found cheering on the <strong>Detroit Redwings</strong>
                  or playing Intramural <strong>soccer</strong> at school. I'm currently
                  seeking software engineering or data science <strong>internships</strong>
                  for <strong>Summer
                  2017</strong>. If you have any questions or would like to know more,
                  my <strong>contact information</strong> is all linked below.
                  Please don't hesitate to reach out, thanks!
